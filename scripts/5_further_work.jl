# # What next?
#
# You now have the discharges and time between the detection sites.  What to do next?


# ## Stage-discharge relation and continuous Q
#
#

# ## Hydraulic friction Factor
#
#


# ## Other
#
# - Make a map of the mapped moulin locations.  Superimpose it on an orthophoto
# - Compare lake discharge to discharge of Gletsch https://www.hydrodaten.admin.ch/de/2268.html
# - Compare discharge errors from different sensors / different detection locations
# - If you mapped a catchment for the supraglacial streams, compare it to the melt-rates inferred
#   by the mass-balance group.  Maybe even in a time-resolved manner...
